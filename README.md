# MonteCarloLocalization2DRobot
Implemented Monte Carlo Localization for a 2D Robot in C++


Monte Carlo localization, also known as particle filter localization, is an algorithm for robots to localize using a particle filter. Given a map of the environment, the algorithm estimates the position and orientation of a robot as it moves and senses the environment.
